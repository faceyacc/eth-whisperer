Challenge:
1. Handle case where last batch is not full in buffer, but no
   more data is coming in.


1.Refactor code to allow KrakenRestAPI to only
  take 'last_n_days' as an argument, and move logic
  for converting time to the kraken_api.py file.
2. Inside the kraken_api.py file, add a helper function (private static method)
   to convert time to the format required by the Kraken API. Return
   timestamps as a tuple.
3. Initalizae 'to' and 'from' timestamp to this helper function
