Fix trade_to_ohlc: currently this services is not reading in historical data from
trade_producer. I suspect the issue is with the 'auto_offset_reset' parameter.



Storing historical data to feature store
1. Add a param from config called "buffer_size" (int)
   to the feature store configuration. This will be
   the number of historical data points read from kafka topic and stores
   in the feature store.
2. Add param to .env file. Set to 1000. default to 1 if not set.
3. Create a buffer variable (list) and push ohlc data to buffer var.
4. When buffer size is reached, push data to feature store.
5. Reset buffer to empty list.
6. Allow data_to_feature_store to be call with a List[dict] for data. (pd.DataFrame(data))
7. Add write_options "start_offline_materialization: False" to feature store configuration.


Challenge:
1. Handle case where last batch is not full in buffer, but no
   more data is coming in.
